## Welcome!

Hi there,

Thank you for downloading The Confidence English Starter Kit!

I'm Ali, the founder of English Conmigo. I created this guide because I know how frustrating it can feel when you understand English but struggle to speak it confidently.

The truth is: confidence comes from practice, not perfection. The tips in this guide are designed to help you start speaking more naturally right away.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: 10 Conversation Starters

Use these phrases to start conversations naturally. They work in almost any situation!

### Meeting Someone New
1. **"So, what do you do?"** - A classic way to learn about someone's work or studies.
2. **"How do you know [host/person]?"** - Perfect for parties or events.
3. **"Have you been here before?"** - Works at restaurants, events, or new places.

### Keeping Conversation Going
4. **"That's interesting! Tell me more about..."** - Shows genuine interest.
5. **"What do you think about...?"** - Invites their opinion on any topic.
6. **"I've always wanted to try that!"** - Connects you to what they're saying.

### At Work or Professional Settings
7. **"What's keeping you busy these days?"** - More interesting than "How are you?"
8. **"How did you get into [their field]?"** - People love sharing their story.

### Universal Starters
9. **"I love your [item]! Where did you get it?"** - Compliments are great openers.
10. **"Can I ask you something?"** - Creates curiosity and opens dialogue.

**Pro Tip:** Don't just ask questions - share something about yourself too! Conversations are two-way.

## Part 2: 5 Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### For Spanish Speakers

**Mistake 1: "I have 25 years"**
Correct: **"I am 25 years old"**
In English, we use "to be" with age, not "to have."

**Mistake 2: "I am agree"**
Correct: **"I agree"**
"Agree" is already a verb - no "am" needed!

**Mistake 3: "Actually" (meaning "currently")**
In English, "actually" means "in fact" or "really."
For "currently," say: **"right now"** or **"at the moment"**

### For Arabic Speakers

**Mistake 4: "The life is beautiful"**
Correct: **"Life is beautiful"**
General concepts don't need "the" in English.

**Mistake 5: "I will can do it tomorrow"**
Correct: **"I will be able to do it tomorrow"**
We can't use two modal verbs together. "Can" becomes "be able to."

## Part 3: 3 Breathing Exercises for Speaking Anxiety

Feeling nervous before speaking English is completely normal. These simple exercises can help calm your nerves.

### Exercise 1: Box Breathing (Before a Meeting/Call)
1. Breathe IN for 4 counts
2. HOLD for 4 counts
3. Breathe OUT for 4 counts
4. HOLD for 4 counts
5. Repeat 4 times

**When to use:** Before video calls, presentations, or any English conversation.

### Exercise 2: The Quick Reset (During Conversation)
If you feel anxious mid-conversation:
1. Take one slow, deep breath
2. Pause (it's okay to pause!)
3. Say: "Let me think about that for a moment..."
4. Continue when ready

**Remember:** Pausing is natural. Native speakers do it too!

### Exercise 3: Morning Confidence Boost
Start your day with 3 minutes of positive preparation:
1. Stand tall, shoulders back
2. Take 5 deep breaths
3. Say out loud: "I am improving every day. Making mistakes helps me learn."

**Why it works:** Your mind believes what you tell it. Start the day confident.

## Bonus: Quick Confidence Mindset Tips

1. **Mistakes are progress.** Every mistake teaches you something.

2. **You don't need perfect grammar.** Communication > perfection.

3. **Speak more, think less.** Overthinking kills fluency.

4. **Celebrate small wins.** Did you order coffee in English? Win!

5. **Compare yourself to yesterday, not to native speakers.** Your only competition is past you.
