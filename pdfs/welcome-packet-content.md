## How Lessons Work

### Before Your Lesson

1. **Find a quiet space** with good lighting and minimal background noise
2. **Test your equipment** - camera, microphone, and internet connection
3. **Have water nearby** - you'll be talking a lot!
4. **Think about topics** you'd like to discuss (optional - your teacher will have ideas too)
5. **Be ready 2-3 minutes early** to log in and get settled

### During Your Lesson (55 minutes)

A typical lesson includes:
- **Warm-up conversation** (5-10 mins) - How was your week? What's new?
- **Main activity** (35-40 mins) - Based on your goals and level
- **Feedback & wrap-up** (5-10 mins) - Key points and next steps

**Remember:**
- It's okay to ask your teacher to repeat or explain something
- It's okay to make mistakes - that's how we learn!
- Speak as much as possible - this is your time to practice

### After Your Lesson

- Your teacher may send follow-up notes or resources
- Practice what you learned throughout the week
- Book your next lesson to maintain momentum

## One Final Note

Learning a language is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be days when you feel frustrated and days when everything clicks.

The key is consistency. Show up, practice, make mistakes, and keep going.

We believe in you, and we're here to support you every step of the way.

Welcome to the English Conmigo family!
